# Progress Report - Meshtastic Visualizer

## Session Date: 2025-08-29

### Starting State
- Basic visualizer running with WebSocket connection
- Nodes appearing but with incorrect hop counts
- Signal strength not displaying
- Multiple nodes incorrectly showing as LOCAL

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. Hop Count Calculation (CRITICAL)
- **Problem**: Formula was backwards (`hopLimit - hopStart`)
- **Solution**: Corrected to `hopStart - hopLimit` in `meshtastic_connector.py`
- **Impact**: Hop counts now display accurately matching iOS Mesh app

#### 2. Signal Strength Data Missing
- **Problem**: Using wrong field names (`rssi`/`snr`)
- **Solution**: Updated to use `rxRssi`/`rxSnr` from Meshtastic packets
- **Impact**: RSSI and SNR values now properly extracted and displayed

#### 3. LOCAL Badge Confusion
- **Problem**: Any node with hop_count=0 showed as LOCAL
- **Solution**: Check node ID against actual local node ID
- **Impact**: Only YOUR node shows LOCAL badge

#### 4. Node Sorting Issues
- **Problem**: Random node ordering in sidebar
- **Solution**: Implemented proper sort: Local → Direct → Multi-hop (ascending)
- **Impact**: Clear visual hierarchy of network topology

### New Features Added

#### Signal Strength Gauge Component
- Visual bars (1-4) colored by signal quality
- Shows RSSI value in dBm
- Compact mode for node list integration
- Color coding: Green (excellent), Yellow (good), Orange (weak), Red (poor)

#### Legend Component
- Shows node type indicators (Local, Router, Client)
- Signal quality reference
- Node size explanation (based on hop distance)
- Link type indicators (Direct vs Multi-hop)

#### Visual Enhancements
- Dynamic node sizing in graph (larger = closer)
- Router nodes as purple diamonds
- Local node with green border
- Improved hop count badges (LOCAL/DIRECT/X HOPS)

### Technical Details

#### Key File Changes
1. `backend/meshtastic_connector.py`:
   - Fixed hop count calculation (line 157)
   - Fixed RSSI/SNR field extraction (lines 163-164)
   - Improved packet logging

2. `frontend/src/components/ActiveNodes.tsx`:
   - Fixed LOCAL badge logic (lines 102-110)
   - Fixed sorting algorithm (lines 55-56)
   - Integrated SignalStrengthGauge component

3. `frontend/src/components/NetworkGraph.tsx`:
   - Dynamic node sizing based on hop count
   - Visual distinction for routers (diamonds)
   - Improved edge validation

### Current State
- ✅ Hop counts display correctly
- ✅ Signal strength shows with visual gauge
- ✅ Proper node categorization (Local/Direct/Multi-hop)
- ✅ Clean visual hierarchy in node list
- ✅ Network graph with dynamic sizing
- ✅ All changes committed to git

### Next Potential Improvements
- Add node details panel (click for expanded info)
- Message history view
- Network statistics dashboard
- GPS position mapping
- Packet type filtering
- Export capabilities for network analysis

### Session Summary
Successfully resolved all critical display issues with hop counts and signal strength. The visualizer now accurately represents the Meshtastic network topology with clear visual indicators for signal quality, hop distance, and node roles. The UI matches expected behavior from the iOS Mesh app and provides intuitive understanding of the mesh network structure.
